            <h1>Group contract</h1>
            <p>1.  Every new feature must be made on its own branch</p>
<br>
            <p>2.  No changes are made directly on the master branch except bug fixes</p>
<br>
            <p>3.  ALWAYS pull from the master branch before doing the last push on a feature branch (to ensure your branch is fully up to date with the entire project)</p>
<br>
            <p>4.  Everyone must review changes before a pull request is made (merged to         master)</p>
<br>
            <p>5. If anyone runs into problems the entire group should be willing to help solve the          problem</p>
<br>
            <p>6. Deadlines should be made for each user story, when it is assigned to a group member. If the user story is not ready within the given time, we should discuss whether or not the story should be reassigned, whether additional members should work on it or whether more time should be assigned.</p>
<br>
            <p>7. There should, optimally, be held a scrum meeting every day throughout the project. The time of the meeting can be planned from day to day. It is okay for a member to be absent:
                if their current task can be solved on their own
                if there has been some sort of personal incident 
                if the person is sick
                if the person has to go to work
                Furthermore it is okay to be late or absent as long as notice is given in due time. </p>
<br>
            <p>8. If we have a disagreement we will take a vote. In case we have an even number of voters then the scrum masters vote will count as 2.</p>
<br>
            <p>9. Irrelevant chatting is in the chatting channel, important decisions in the general channelâ€¦ ect.</p>
